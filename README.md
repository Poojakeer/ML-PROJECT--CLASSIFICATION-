Product Shipment Delivered on time or not Machine Learning projectProduct Shipment Delivered on time or not Machine Learning project
Nov 2022 - Dec 2022Nov 2022 - Dec 2022

Tool Used:- Jupyter

Key skills:- Advanced Python, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine Learning Algorithms.

Objective:- The goal of Machine learning is to train a model on labelled data to do analysis by finding the best fit model for product delivery on time on e-com dataset, having multiple variables of customer review / feedback.

Working:- 
1.Detecting whether Product Shipment would be delivered on time or not. I applied multiple algorithms on e-com dataset, having 10999 variables of customer review / feedback. 
2.By applying multiple algorithm such as - logistic regression , Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, KNneighbours Classifier, Support Vector Classifier & Tuned the Parameter of every algorithm 
where Decision Tree got good balance between Score .
3.Plotted confusion Matrix predicted vs Actual Label for whole data then plotted after hyperparameter tuning for decision tree where I got the 99% accuracy.
4.Found the Feature Importance for the data for improving the model.
